                        is an extension of the Logo programming language. With traditional versions

                        of Logo, you can create drawings and animations by giving commands to

                        a graphic "turtle" on the computer screen. StarLogo extends this idea

                        by allowing you to control thousands of graphic turtles in parallel.

                        In addition, StarLogo makes the turtles' world computationally active:

                        you can write programs for thousands of "patches" that make up the turtles'

                        environment. Turtles and patches can interact with one another. For

                        example, you can program the turtles to "sniff" around the world, and

                        change their behaviors based on what they sense in the patches below.

                        StarLogo is particularly well-suited for modeling complex decentralized

                        systems--systems which traditionally have not been available to people

                        without advanced mathematical or programming skills. </font></p>

                        includes three main types of "characters": <i><br>

                            <br>

                            Turtles</i>. The main inhabitants of the StarLogo world are graphic

                        creatures known as "turtles." You can use a turtle to represent almost

                        any type of object: an ant in a colony, a car in a traffic jam, an antibody

                        in an immune system, a molecule in a gas. Each turtle has a position,

                        a heading, a color, and a "pen" for drawing. You can add more specialized

                        traits and properties. In StarLogo (unlike traditional versions of Logo),

                        you can control the actions and interactions of <i>thousands</i> of

                        turtles in parallel. <i><br>

                            <br>

                            Patches</i>. Patches are pieces of the world in which the turtles live.

                        Patches are not merely passive objects upon which the turtles act. Like

                        turtles, patches can execute StarLogo commands, and they can act on

                        turtles and patches. Patches are arranged in a grid, with each patch

                        corresponding to a square in the Graphics area. <i><br>

                            <br>

                            Observer</i>. The observer "looks down" on the turtles and patches from

                        a bird's eye perspective. The observer can create new turtles, and it

                        can monitor the activity of the existing turtles and patches. </font></p>

                            The StarLogo interface consists of several main windows: <i><br>

                            sections. The initially black Graphics area is where the StarLogo

                            turtles move and draw. The turtles move on top of a grid of patches.

                            When a turtle moves off the screen, it "wraps" around to the other

                            side. You can move a turtle directly by dragging it with the mouse.

                            The white area on the left of the Graphics area is the Interface area.

                            This area is where you will create buttons, sliders, and monitors

                            that allow you to interact directly with StarLogo programs. To create

                            and inspect interface objects (that is, buttons, sliders, and monitors),

                            use the Main Toolbar, located in the gray bar across the top of the

                            StarLogo window. To create a new interface object, choose the appropriate

                            tool from the Toolbar and drag out a rectangle in the Interface area.

                            To inspect the underlying behavior of an existing interface object,

                            choose the appropriate tool from the Toolbar and then click on the

                            object. (You can also inspect an object by holding down control and

                            double-clicking on the object with the standard arrow tool.) The Paint

                            and Color Toolbar appears above the Graphics area when you click the

                            paintbrush icon from the Main Toolbar. From here, you can select which

                            color you want to draw with. In addition, you can select different

                            types of drawing tools.</font></p>
