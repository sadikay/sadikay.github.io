<h3>Deploying Rails on Ubuntu Digitalocean, Nginx, Unicorn, Mina</h3>
<p>In the this post I ll try to make I tutorial about deploying of Rails Applications
 by solving issues which I got.
So, I think for rails developers the most painful sections is: <b>Deploying</b> (specially first deploy).
</p>
<p>I ll start from assuming your Rails app works properly in localhost and it have configured on VCS (github etc.)</p>
<p>If you have an account on Digitaloceon, Login and create a droplet like in following way. In the case
  of you have not an account on Digitalocean you can Sign In by using my referral
