<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">Hi</span> everyone! In the my first post we ll talk about which kind of content you could find in this blog. </p>
<p class="intro">To defining the blog I think the best sentence is:
 <b>Some software, some travel and completely freedom.</b></p>

<p>
  So, let's talk about to which software technologies usually we ll touch on.

  In this blog you could find which technologies are trend, which technologies have advantages, which technologies promise etc.

  Also we ll compare these technologies between each others as well.
</p>

<p>
     If you are reading this post right know, probably you know that '<b>I am a Rubyist.</b>'
     So what does it mean the 'Rubyist'. As wiki definition Rubyist is 'A user of the Ruby programming language'.
     In my opinion that's true but it is incomplete. It should be:
     <b>'A user of the Ruby programming language who's using Ruby with love' <3.</b>
</p>
<p>
    Of course we'll talk about the technologies or programming languages out of Ruby,
    but maybe we can talk about Ruby a little bit more and further.
</p>

    Also, don't worry if you see any amazing photo in any post :). Take a seat and <b>Enjoy!</b>
